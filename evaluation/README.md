# Evaluation
Folder for anything evaluation related, except the respective data (see folder data).

## reference-distributions
Creates distributions of word lengths accoring to ZLA:
+ Oprimal Coding: upper boundary for coding efficiency ([Ferrer-i-Cancho, Dębowski & del Prado Martín, 2013](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2013/07/L07001/meta))
+ Monkey Typing: ZLA respecting distribution, that functions similar to certain natural language mechanisms. Not implemented, yet.
+ Exemplar natural languages: Ideally, word length distributions of natural languages are used as [Chaabouni et al. (2019)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/31ca0ca71184bbdb3de7b20a51e88e90-Abstract.html) did with English and Arabic . So far we did not find acess to such data.

## evaluation
Several helper functions for making evaluation easier (see individual docstrings).
